# torn-market-scraper

This is a script for a game called [Torn](torn.com). There is a player market that is entirely based on buying things and selling them to other players for slightly higher prices. 

This script uses the [Torn API](https://www.torn.com/api.html) to scrape the lowest prices of a subset of items in which it is consistently profitable to do this with, and output a link to the page to purchase the item.
